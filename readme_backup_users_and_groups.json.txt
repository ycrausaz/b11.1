# Step 1: Backup the user and group data
python manage.py dumpdata auth.User auth.Group --indent 2 > backup_users_and_groups.json

# This command uses `dumpdata` to export the data from the `auth.User` and `auth.Group` models.
# The `--indent 2` option makes the JSON output more readable.
# The `>` operator redirects the output to a file named `backup_users_and_groups.json`.

# Step 2: Save the backup file
# Ensure the `backup_users_and_groups.json` file is saved in a safe location, preferably outside the project directory,
# so it is not affected by the database reset.

# Step 3: Reset your database
# This step depends on your specific use case and might involve deleting the database and recreating it,
# running migrations, or any other steps necessary to reset the database.

# Step 4: Restore the user and group data
python manage.py loaddata backup_users_and_groups.json

# This command uses `loaddata` to import the data from the `backup_users_and_groups.json` file.
# It will restore the data for the `auth.User` and `auth.Group` models in the database.
